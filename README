Currently, PHP backend for interacting with the Subsonic API and an ajax tester are the only things working.
Work on the ExtJS frontend has only begun.

Browse to ajaxTester.php to try out the ajax tester, which can display results in multiple formats.
For the ajax to work, you will need to create config.php in the root directory
and add the following class to it, filling in your information.

class Creds {
	const Username = '';
	const Password = '';
	const ServerURL = '';
	const ServerPort = '4040';
}


All the subsonic API commands work as a function in the Subsonic class, and take 1 optional parameter,
	an array of options for the command.

Visit the subsonic api documentation for information on the commands:

http://subsonic.org/pages/api.jsp


Example:

require_once("config.php");

$Subsonic = new Subsonic(Creds::Username, Creds::Password, Creds::ServerUrl, Creds::ServerPort);

print_r($Subsonic->getMusicFolders());

$options = array("musicFolderId" => "0");

print_r($Subsonic->getIndexes($options));
