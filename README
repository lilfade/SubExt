For the ajax to work, you will need to modify config.php with your credentials

All the subsonic API commands work as a function in the Subsonic class, and take 1 optional parameter,
	an array of options for the command.

Visit the subsonic api documentation for information on the commands:

http://http://subsonic.org/pages/api.jsp


Example:

$Subsonic = new Subsonic($username, $password, $serverUrl, $serverPort);

print_r($Subsonic->getMusicFolders());

$options = array("musicFolderId" => "0");

print_r($Subsonic->getIndexes($options));
